		Lei Luo Qing Shan is a RPG game we started from 2011 with RPG Maker and Ruby. It won the first prize in 2012 Summer Practice in Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University.
		</p><p>
		We started from a little group of super fans of <b><i>The Legend of Sword and Fairy</i></b> who want to show our own story to the world. As most 
		of us are programmers and we were really a small group, we do not have clear roles.
		</p><p>
		I implemeted most branches, implemented part of the systerm code, added other people(except main characters) to the scenes, and determined cover zone and walkable parts for one third of the maps.

		At first we really had a hard time as we did not have any professional art or sound designer and we were too ambitious. We learned a lot of new things from scratch. We we changed our main story twice, and even almost restarted once. 
		</p><p>
		But after we won the prize things became kind of better. Some artists came to help us. We also became more clear about our goal.
		</p><p>
		Now we already finishend two rounds of test and we are still keep polishing it about details, data, and so on. Just email me if you are intereste in this or wang to join us!
