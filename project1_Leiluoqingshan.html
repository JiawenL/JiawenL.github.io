		Lei Luo Qing Shan(磊落青衫) is a Chinese style RPG game, which we started at 2011 with RPG Maker and Ruby. We won the first prize with Lei Luo Qing Shan in 2012 Summer Practice in Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University.
		</p><p>
		The team is a small group of <i>The Legend of Sword and Fairy</i> fans and wanted to make our own game and then started making the game in 2011.
		</p><p>
		My main contributions have been in implementing most branches of the story and also part of the system code, adding wholesome NPCs who are alive in game world, and determined the 2.5D level navigation mechanics.

		Despite being an all programmer team, we worked together and despite many technical challenges, created art that suited the experience we wanted to make. This was an amazing learning experience.

		The publicity of having won an award brought in artists to help us grow the game. Now, having experienced making all parts of a game, we became better at planning and were now equipped to expand our game.
		</p><p>
		In the latest version of the game, there are 259 scenes and more than 500 tasks that can provide a total playing time of 72 hours. Now we already finished two rounds of test and we are still keep polishing it about details, data, and so on.
