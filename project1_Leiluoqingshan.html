		Lei Luo Qing Shan is a Chinese style RPG game, which we started at 2011 with RPG Maker and Ruby. We won the first prize with Lei Luo Qing Shan in 2012 Summer Practice in Department of Computer Science, Tsinghua University.

		We are a small group of super fans of <i>The Legend of Sword and Fairy</i> and want to make our own game. As most of us are programmers and we were really a small group, we do not have clear roles.
		</p><p>
		I implemeted most branches and part of the systerm code, added other people (except main characters) to the scenes, and determined cover zone as well as walkable parts in one third of the maps.

		At first, we had a hard time as we did not have any professional art or sound designer and we were too ambitious. We learned a lot of new things from scratch. We designed four different start scences, changed the main story twice, and even almost restarted once. 
		</p><p>
		Fortunately, after we won the prize, things became better. Some artists came to help us. We also became more clear about our goal.
		</p><p>
		In the latest version of the game, there are 259 scences and more than 500 tasks that can provide a total playing time of 72 hours. Now we already finished two rounds of test and we are still keep polishing it about details, data, and so on. Just email me if you are interested in this or want to join us!
