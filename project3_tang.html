		<p>Dream in Tang Dynasty is a life simulation game based on Qt and C++ made by myself in 2012. I decided to make this because I was a super fan of <i>Princess Maker</i> at that time.
		</p><p>
		In the game, you can control and name a girl who lives in Tang Dynasty in ancient China from 10 years old to 17 years old. During the 7 years, she can work, learn, talk with people, join activities, and some other things could happen at that time. You should help her protect her family from being killed by the emperor. Finally, she can become successful, a normal woman or even worse, marry someone she loves or not, or even totally change the history of Tang Dynasty.
		</p><p>
		I wrote the whole story tree for this game, and learned Qt from this project. All the art assets and sound effect were download from open source website, and I edited some of them with Photoshop.
