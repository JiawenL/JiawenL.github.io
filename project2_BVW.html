		<p>Building Virtual Worlds (BVW) is a project focused course in ETC. We build five games with different platforms - Kinect, Oculus Rift, Leap Motion, Eye Gazer and PS Move in group of five(two programmers, two artists, one sound designer).
		</p><p>
		My role for BVW is a programmer. At the end of the course, the best worlds were showcased at a festival where industry professionals come to experience our worlds. Two of my five games made into the festival(17 out of 75). All games developed during BVW uses the Unity Engine.

		In the game, player can guide a fairy with a target controlled by your eyes. Player should help fairy avoid all the traps, escape from the darkness, and try to beat the high score.
