		<p>Building Virtual Worlds (BVW) is a project focused course in ETC. We build five games with different platforms - Kinect, Oculus Rift, Leap Motion, Eye Gazer and PS Move in group of five(two programmers, two artists, one sound designer).
		</p><p>
		My role for BVW is a programmer. At the end of the course, the best worlds were showcased at a festival where industry professionals come to experience our worlds. Two of my five games made into the festival(17 out of 75). All games developed during BVW uses the Unity Engine.

		Harsh Light
		</b></p><p>
		Harsh Light is the game we made with Eye Gazer in one week.
		</p><p>
		For this game, I implemented a controller for all traps, interfaces for generating the trap, the score system and the score board.
		</p><p>
		It is a 2D side scroller avoidance game using the EyeGaze eye tracker. Using only eye movements, you control a spotlight that the fairy flies to. With a limited vision of only an area where you are looking at, be compelled to forsee shadow traps ahead while avoiding them. Guide the fairy away from a variety of traps that will harm her and escape into the light.

		Muse Meow
		</b></p><p>
		Muse Meow is a game we made with PS Move in three weeks.
		</p><p>
		For this game, I implemented the event controller for the whole story and auto-checkpoints for each step. As an added interaction in the experience, we sang together in a live band which made up the background music for the game.
		</p><p>
		In this game, a happy cat jumps out of a painting - The Scream cause a dog is chasing him. Player should help the cat with PS Move to go through HomoVitruvianus, The Persistence of Memory, Mona Lisa, The Shrimps, Last Supper, escape from the dog, and go back to his original painting!

		Summoning Santa
		</b></p><p>
		This is an experience work with Makey Makey and a 55-inch pyramid hologram built by ourselves. This did not make to the festival as it could only serve 4 guests for each 10 minutes, but it won the only First Penguin Award for that semester.
		</p><p>
		For this game, I built those small Makey Makey gingerbread voodoo cookies, implemented the camera controller that can transfer the initial camera outputs to four-sides output for hologram in real time, and also implemented our DMX light controller.
		</p><p>
		In this interactive play, guests enter the room and see a ghostly apparition of Santa Claus in the hologram pyramid and hear him calling for help. With Santa's instruction, the guests perform the summoning ritual which involves pouring milk, serving cookies, ringing a bell, lighting a candle, and tracing a heptagram in a spellbook. After performing the ritual, the guests realize that they have actually summoned the devious Krampus. Sensing trouble, the real Santa emerges from the fireplace. Then Santa instructs the guests to try different ways may help defeat the monster such as to stab gingerbread voodoo cookies. Finally the guests can defeat the Krampus, then Santa gives the guests candy canes and wishes them a Merry Christmas.

		Haiku
		</b></p><p>
		This is a game made in two weeks, for this game I implemented player controller, all trigger mechanism.
		</p><p>
		In this game, guests walk through an abstract environment based on Japanese Ukiyo-e art. As they follow the path of a quiet stream they encounter abstract sculptures floating in space. Viewing these sculptures from the proper angle causes the shapes to align in perspective, creating a concrete image. Each image is accompanied by a line from a Masaoka Shiki haiku.
