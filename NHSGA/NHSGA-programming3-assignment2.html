		1. Overview
		</b></p><p>
		This assignment will help you better understand the framework of GameObject in Unity.Engine. </br>For this assignment, you need to implement a simple mechanic by your own in C# for Unity.
		</br></br></p>
		<p><b>
		2. Requirements
		</b></p><p>
For this assignment, you need to make a simple game with Unity that <b>fit the requirements</b> below.</br></br>
If you are confident about yourself, you can implement your own idea, do whatever you want from scratch with Unity.</br>
If you are not sure, you can play with the handout project we provide. You can change anything there.</br>
If you really not sure, you can just follow the note below and fill all TODOs inside the handout project.</br></br></br>
		</p><p>
		<b>Here are the requirements:</br></b>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. Use loop(for/while) and if condition in your code.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. Use Instantiate and Destroy in your code.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Create a prefab in your project.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. Use physic system in your project(detect collision, use rigidbody, or force/velocity/acceleration, etc.)</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp5. Make your game interactive.</br></br>
		</p><p><b>
Be Creative!</br>
Have Fun!</br>
Surprise Us!</br></br>

3. Handout
</b></p><p>
For those who are not so familiar with basic programming syntax or object-oriented programming or have already forgot what you have learned, we provide you a half-finished Unity project. You can finish the same breakout as we made in class by follow the note and fulfill the TODOs.

Note:
</p><p>
&nbsp&nbspWhat do you need to do with Unity:</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. Make a brick prefab.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. Make a physic Material for the walls, platform, ball, and your brick prefab.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Add a rigidbody to the Ball. Adjust the parameters to what you need.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. Set platform for Ball's public variable as you need it to return the Ball back to its start position when the player lose.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp5. Attach the brick prefab to brick_generator.</br>
</p><p>
&nbsp&nbspTODOs:</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. First, you need a brick generating function in brick_generator.cs which is already attached on the GameObject brick_generator.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. To handle the keyboard input and control the platform, you need to finish the update function in paltform_controler.cs which is already attached on the GameObject platform.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Then, you need to finish the update function in ball.cs so that you can start the game.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. At last but not least, please finish the TODO in brick.cs, then your bricks will be destroyed when they get hit.</br>

4. Hand in
</b></p><p>
You should hand in your homework to randon under your own folder inside Assignments/Group_A3/ or Assignments/Group_B3/.</br>
</p><p>
Please create a folder called 'p_a2_XXX' where 'XXX' should be your andrewID inside your own folder on randon. Inside this 'p_a2_XXX':</br>
&nbsp&nbsp 1. You need a folder named whatever you want which should be your Unity project. You need to copy the whole Assets folder and Projectseeting folder here.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp 2. You need a folder named build. Inside this folder, you need a build which means an excutable file and its data folder.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp 3. If you think you need it, you can put a README file here include things you want like describe you project, describe your mechanic, etc. This file can only be a TXT/pdf/doc.</br>
