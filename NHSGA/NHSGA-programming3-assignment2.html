		1. Overview
		</b></p><p>
		This assignment will help you better understand the framework of GameObject in Unity.Engine. </br>For this assignment, you need to implement a simple mechanic by your own in C# for Unity.
		</br></br></p>
		<p><b>
		2. Requirements
		</b></p><p>
For this assignment, you need to make a simple game with Unity and <b>fit the requirements</b> below.</br></br>
If you are confident about yourself, you can implement your own idea, do whatever you want from scratch with Unity.</br>
If you are not sure, you can play with the handout project we provide. You can change anything there. We set numbers only for saving your time on balancing numbers.</br>
If you really not sure, you can just follow the note below and fill all TODOs inside the handout project.</br></br></br>
		</p><p>
		<b>Here are the requirements:</br></b>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. Use loop(for/while) and if in your code.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. Use Instantiate and Destroy in your code.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Create a prefab in your project.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. Use physic system in your project(detect collision, use rigidbody, or force/velocity/acceleration, etc.)</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp5. Make your game interactive.</br></br>
		</p><p><b>
Be Creative!</br>
Have Fun!</br></br>

Note:
</p><p>
&nbsp&nbspWhat do you need to do with Unity:</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. Make a brick prefab.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. Make a physic Material for the walls, platform, ball, and your brick prefab.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Add a rigidbody to the Ball. Adjust the parameters to what you need.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. Set platform for Ball's public variable as you need it to put the Ball back when the player lose.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp5. Set the brick prefab in brick generator.</br>
</p><p>
&nbsp&nbspTODOs:</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1. First, you need a brick generating function in brick_generator.cs which is already attached on the GameObject brick_generator.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2. To handle the keyboard input and control the platform, you need to finish the update function in paltform_controler.cs which is already attached on the GameObject platform.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp3. Then, you need to finish the update function in ball.cs so that you can start the game.</br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp4. At last but not least, please finish the TODO in brick.cs then your bricks will be destroyed when they get hit.</br>
